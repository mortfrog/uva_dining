== UVA Dining API

This is a simple webservice created which we'll use in a mobile app for a class. It will grow and expand until December, 2010. Until further notice, it is deployed on uvadining.heroku.com/*


Currently implemented:

/locations(.format)

Returns a list of locations (Runk, Newcomb, OHill), whether they are open, and what they are open for (lunch, dinner, etc).

JSON Example output:
[{"dining_hall":{"name":"Runk","open":true,"meal":"Soup And Salad"}},
{"dining_hall":{"name":"Newcomb","open":true,"meal":"Lunch"}},
{"dining_hall":{"name":"Ohill","open":true,"meal":"Lunch"}}]

/locations/*name*(.format)

JSON Example, /locations/ohill:
[{"dining_hall":{"name":"Ohill","open":true,"meal":"Lunch"}}]

Planned Features

We are going to provide a full menu with each location call, as well as links to nutrition facts of the foods.

There will be more keys and features added on in the future, with rare updates to this.
